Are You Serious? Yes.


MAKE SURE TO READ BELOW BEFORE GETTING STARTED FOR THE FIRST TIME!


You may be thinking…

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA…WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

But before you freak out, take a few minutes to peek inside
the library/less folder to see a plethora of new files.
LESS, you say, but isn't that complicated? Nope. It does take
a few minutes to wrap your head around, but it will all
be worth it. Need a quick intro? Here are a few quick reads:

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you are going to be working with
LESS, that you DO NOT parse it using the javascript file. It can
be a HUGE performance hit and it kind of defeats the whole reasoning
behind using LESS.

That being said, here are a few MUST HAVE TOOLS for working with the
new Responsive version of Bones: (You really only need one of them)

CodeKit: (Highly Recommended)
http://incident57.com/codekit/

LESS App:
http://incident57.com/less/

LESS Coda Plugin: 
http://incident57.com/coda/

SimpLESS: (Windows Users)
http://wearekiss.com/simpless

These applications compile LESS into minified, valid CSS. This
way you can keep your production LESS file easy to read and your
CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the output to the
library/css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.

IF YOU PREFER THE OLD CSS, DON'T WORRY, IT'S IN THE CSS FOLDER
TITLED "old-style.css". JUST RENAME IT AND REPLACE THIS FILE.

(also, if you're going to use the old-style.css, you'll want to
use the respond.js file inside the js/libs/ folder. Load it
after Modernizr in the header)

Remember, once you download Bones it's up to you how to use it
so go nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for
you. If LESS is still a bit confusing for you, then you can also 
download the Classic version of Bones and work with that.

If you're frustrated with this new direction and don't like change,
take a few minutes and think about how much better a developer you 
can become by just TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at 
first but it WILL make you a better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS. Give
it a week, maybe two, and you will never go back.

Happy Developing!
