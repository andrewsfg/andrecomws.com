Stylesheet: 481px and Up Stylesheet

This stylesheet is loaded for larger devices. It's set to 
481px because at 480px it would load on a landscaped iPhone.
This isn't ideal because then you would be loading all those
extra styles on that same mobile connection. 

A word of warning. This size COULD be a larger mobile device,
so you still want to keep it pretty light and simply expand
upon your base.less styles.

wrapping styles in a function so we can call it
inside of media queries. We also do this so we can
call this function in the ie.less file. Which means
IE will get all the styles without any hefty work.
