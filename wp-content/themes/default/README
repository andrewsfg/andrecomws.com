/******************************************************************
Bones (Responsive Edition)
A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme
Developed by Eddie Machado

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.

This is the responsive version and uses a lot of the latest "best practices" 
for designing responsive sites. It uses the "Mobile First" approach 
so that the smallest screens always get the lightest load.

/******************************************************************
USING THE CSS & LESS STYLESHEETS
******************************************************************/

LESS, you say, but isn't that complicated? Nope. It does take
a few minutes to wrap your head around, but it will all
be worth it. Need a quick intro? Here are a few quick reads:

http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/09/an-introduction-to-less-and-comparison-to-sass/

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you are going to be working with
LESS, that you DO NOT parse it using the javascript file. It can
be a HUGE performance hit and it kind of defeats the whole reasoning
behind using LESS.

That being said, here are a few MUST HAVE TOOLS for working with the
new Responsive version of Bones: (You really only need one of them)

CodeKit: (Highly Recommended)
http://incident57.com/codekit/

LESS App:
http://incident57.com/less/

LESS Coda Plugin: 
http://incident57.com/coda/

SimpLESS: (Windows Users)
http://wearekiss.com/simpless

These applications compile LESS into minified, valid CSS. This
way you can keep your production LESS file easy to read and your
CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the output to the
library/css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.

IF YOU PREFER THE OLD CSS, DON'T WORRY, IT'S IN THE CSS FOLDER
TITLED "old-style.css". JUST RENAME IT AND REPLACE THIS FILE.

(also, if you're going to use the old-style.css, you'll want to
use the respond.js file inside the js/libs/ folder. Load it
after Modernizr in the header)

Remember, once you download Bones it's up to you how to use it
so go nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for
you. If LESS is still a bit confusing for you, then you can also 
download the Classic version of Bones and work with that.

If you're frustrated with this new direction and don't like change,
take a few minutes and think about how much better a developer you 
can become by just TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at 
first but it WILL make you a better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS. Give
it a week, maybe two, and you will never go back.

/******************************************************************
SUPPORT, ISSUES, & QUESTIONS
******************************************************************/

Since this is a Starter Theme for Developers, there's no REAL
Support system. Bones is meant to be customized and changed to fit
your development preferences. So download a copy and delete what 
you don't need and add whatever may be missing.

Find a bug or know of a better way to accomplish a goal? Then 
please head over to these the project page on github and help me
make Bones better!
